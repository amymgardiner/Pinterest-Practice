# About Project
I wanted to make a responsive Pinterest page as a personal challenge to myself to try and recreate their iconic style.

Because I'm a huge fangirl and all around nerd, I decided to make the homepage for fictional character, Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Pinterest account.

I used React to build this app. I made sure to follow the React practice of code-splitting by having several components. I also used the state hook for the filtering/categories feature on this app.

For styling I used regular CSS, Tailwind CSS, and Masonry Layout CSS to achieve a responsive grid layout for the images/cards as well as hover effects for several elements.

This was a fun project for code practice and I hope you enjoy!
