# About Project
I wanted to make a responsive Pinterest page to recreate their iconic style.

I used React to build this app, Masonry Layout CSS to achieve a responsive grid layout for the images/cards, and my own imagination to create the fictional homepage of Hermione Granger's Pinterest account.

Enjoy!
